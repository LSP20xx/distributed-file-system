#Distributed File System

This is a Distributed File System implemented in Go. It supports file storage, retrieval, and peer-to-peer (P2P) communication for sharing files across a network.
Features

    Distributed File Storage: Store files on multiple nodes in the network.
    P2P Communication: Communicate with other nodes in the network to retrieve and store files.
    File Encryption: Securely encrypt and decrypt files during transmission.

Installation
Prerequisites

    Go (version 1.18 or higher)
    Git

Cloning the Repository

bash

git clone https://github.com/LSP20xx/distributed-file-system.git
cd distributed-file-system

Building the Project

You can build the project by running:

bash

go build

This will generate an executable file in your project directory.
Usage
Running the File Server

To start a file server, use the following command:

bash

./distributed-file-system

Storing a File

You can store a file in the distributed system by calling the Store method:

go

err := fileServer.Store("filename", fileReader)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal("Failed to store file: ", err)
}

Retrieving a File

To retrieve a file from the distributed system:

go

reader, err := fileServer.Get("filename")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal("Failed to retrieve file: ", err)
}

Running Tests

You can run tests using the following command:

bash

go test ./...

Configuration

You can configure the FileServer by passing a FileServerOpts struct:

go

fileServerOpts := FileServerOpts{
    ID:                "your-server-id",
    EncKey:            []byte("your-encryption-key"),
    StorageRoot:       "./data",
    PathTransformFunc: customPathTransform,
    Transport:         yourTransportImplementation,
    BootstrapNodes:    []string{"node1:port", "node2:port"},
}

fileServer := NewFileServer(fileServerOpts)
